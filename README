Extension Checklist (for rv32gc):

[x] rvi
[ ] rvm
[ ] rva
[ ] rvf
[ ] rvd
[ ] rvc
[ ] User Mode
[ ] Supervisor Mode
[ ] Machine Mode

Design Roadmap:

1. rv32i single-stage
2. rvc
3. ucode for rvm, rvf, and rva
4. separate frontend and backend in 2 stages
5. transfer rvm, rvf, and rva into pipelined exec. units
6. pipeline frontend/tomasulo
7. optimize to hell

Memory Layout:

0x0000-0x7fff:	Flash program memory		(r xc)
0x8000-0xbfff:	Random access memory		(rwxc)
0xc000-0xc00c:	Timer (mtime and mtimecmp)	(rw  )

Cache:

Instruction and data cache are both 4 KiB direct-mapped caches with 64 byte lines. Read hits are carried out immediately, with misses creating 1 cycle of latency.

Write hits are also carried out immediately. The data cache is write-allocate, so write misses introduce 1 cycle of latency to retrieve old data from main memory. The data cache is also write-through, so all writes become visible to other harts 1 cycle after the write is completed. Write-through does not delay program execution.

The caches interface with the hart and with main memory through a simple handshake mechanism (valid and ready signals for addresses and data), meaning, in theory, the system should work with any amount of latency in cache and memory operation (untested).
